## About
This is Expenses Calculator, built with React and deployed on Heroku https://my-budgetcalculator.herokuapp.com/

This little project uses the whole bunch of modern React app features like React Hooks, and really cool custom hook - useForm, that allows us to control multiple inputs state in one hook.

App has the whole spectrum of CRUD operations, plus this app persists data you have entered in local storage, so you do not have to worry about losing your expenses after refreshing the page, also I have implemented very cute notifications with react-notify, hope you enjoy this little app =)
